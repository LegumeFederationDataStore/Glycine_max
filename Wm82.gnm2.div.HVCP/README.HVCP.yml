file_transformation: 
  - Convert GmHapMap_Gt.gz into a VCF file and add SoyBase names. 
	- 1) Add REF and ALT alleles
		- took the first 4 columns fo GmHaMap.VarType.gz, which contain CHROM, POS, REF, ALT and pasted this information to GmHapMap_GT
		- used AWK '{(if $2 != $6) print "no" }' to make sure the paste worked and the information is the same.
		- removed columns 5 & 6, which were duplicate CHROM and POS columns 
		- used GmHapMapGt-to-vcf.py to convert into VCF file format
		- replaced the header the script created with the header from GmHapMap.var.ann.gz
	- 2) Assign and Add SoyBase names#
                - use script assign_names.awk to assign names (A01-00000001) to each SNP and add them to the VCF file.
