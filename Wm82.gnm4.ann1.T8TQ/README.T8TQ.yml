provenance: The files in this directory originated from http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov. The Phytozome repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below.  The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo, PeanutBase, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo, PeanutBase, and Legume Federation project(s). If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please 1) please cite the data appropriately - generally referring to the original publications for this data; and if you make use of any significant modifications in the files (noted below under "Transformations" where applicable), then please also cite the respective database project(s) related to this directory.

file_transformation: 
  - Prefixed fasta files with glyma.Wm82.gnm2. and removed .p suffix:
    - perl -pi -e 's/>(\S+).p* />glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.$1 /' *.faa
  - Prefixed gene IDs in nucleotide fasta:
    - perl -pi -e 's/>(\S+) />glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.$1 /' *fna
  - Added chromosome prefix to GFFs:
    - perl -pi -e 's/^([^#]\S+)/glyma.Wm82.gnm4.$1/' *gff3
  - Added gene prefixes to GFFs (also replacing version suffixes):
    - perl -pi -e 's/.Wm82.a4.v1//g; s/=Glyma\./glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.Glyma./g' *gff3
  - Derived gene function information from GFF3:
    - TAB=$'\t'; 
    - zcat glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.T8TQ.gene_models_main.gff3.gz |
    -    awk -v FS="$TAB" '$3=="gene" {print $9}' |
    -    perl -pe 's/.+Name=//; s/;ancestorIdentifier=[^;]+;/\t/; s/;Dbxref=[^;]+;/\t/; s/Note=//; s/^(\w+\.\w+);/$1\t/; s/%2C/,/ig; s/%3B/;/ig; s/%3D/=/ig' \
    -    > glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.T8TQ.info_gene_annot.txt
    
changes: 
  - 2018-07-20 Initial preparation for Legume Federation data store.
  - 2018-08-16 Applied prefixes to fasta and GFF files - see file_transformations above.
  - 2019-05-28 Added files .info_gene_annot.txt and .info_annot.txt
  - 2020-09-22 added gene family assignments
