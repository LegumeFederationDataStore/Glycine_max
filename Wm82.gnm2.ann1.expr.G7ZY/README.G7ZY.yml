changes: 
  - 2019-05-07: Creation of metadata and formatting of files for this repository
  - 2019-07-12: Creation of VCF file glyma.Wm82.gnm2.div.HVCP.NonSynSNPs.vcf.gz, a VCF file only containing Non-Synonymous SNP locations. Using the file GmHapMap.var.ann file produced from SnpEff, SNPs that were annotated as having a HIGH or MODERATE effect were assigned as Non-Synonymous SNP locations. These locations were then extracted from the original VCF file glyma.Wm82.gnm2.div.HVCP.SNPData.vcf.gz to produce this new VCF file. 
  - 2020-01-06: Added files: glyma.Wm82.gnm2.div.HVCP.genotypes_by_gene.hmp.gz glyma.Wm82.gnm2.div.HVCP.haplotypes_by_gene.tsv.gz glyma.Wm82.gnm2.div.HVCP.loss_of_function.xlsx.gz . See file transformation notes above.
